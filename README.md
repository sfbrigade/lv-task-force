# Full Stack Starter

This repository contains a "starter" project for web application development in JavaScript. This includes the following components, from front-end to back-end:

- React
- React Router
- Mantine
- Vite
- Fastify
- Prisma
- Node.js
- Postgres

## One-time Setup

1. On Github, "Fork" this git repo to your own account so that you have your own copy.

   Read more about "forking" here:  
   https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo

2. Clone YOUR copy of the git repo to a "local" directory (on your computer), then change
   into the directory.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/full-stack-starter.git
   cd full-stack-starter
   ```

3. Install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

   1. Windows users see notes below...

4. Open a command-line shell, change into your repo directory, and execute these commands:

   ```
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up
   ```

   It will take a while the first time you run these commands to download the "images" to
   run the web application code in Docker "containers". When you see messages that look
   like this, the server is running:

   ```
   full-stack-starter-server-1       | 5:31:23 PM client.1 |    VITE v4.3.9  ready in 327 ms
   full-stack-starter-server-1       | 5:31:23 PM client.1 |    ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5000/
   ```

5. Now you should be able to open the web app in your browser at: http://localhost:5000/

6. Open a new tab or window of your shell, change into your repo directory as needed, and execute this command:

   ```
   docker compose exec server bash -l
   ```

   This will log you in to the running server container, as if you were connecting to a different machine over the Internet.
   Once you're logged in, you will be in a new shell for the container where you can run the following command:

   ```
   bin/create-admin.js Firstname Lastname email password
   ```

   Put in your name and email address and a password. This will create a first admin user in the database.

7. To stop the server, press CONTROL-C in the window with the running server.
   If it is successful, you will see something like this:

   ```
   Killing full-stack-starter_db_1           ... done
   Killing full-stack-starter_server_1       ... done
   Killing full-stack-starter_mailcatcher_1  ... done
   ```

   If it is not successful, you may see something like this:

   ```
   ERROR: Aborting.
   ```

   If you get an error, the server may still be running on your computer. To force it to stop,
   run the following command and wait for the output to report DONE:

   ```
   docker compose stop
   Stopping full-stack-starter_db_1          ... done
   Stopping full-stack-starter_server_1      ... done
   Stopping full-stack-starter_mailcatcher_1 ... done
   ```

8. That's it! After all this setup is complete, the only command you need to run to get
   started again is the `docker compose up` command.

## Development Tools

This project includes components with helpful developer tools, such as the following:

1. Mailcatcher

   The Docker Compose configuration includes the Mailcatcher development mail server. Email sent from the
   server will be captured by this mail server and can be viewed on the web at:

   http://localhost:1080

   NO live emails will be sent over the Internet.

2. Prisma Studio

   The Prisma library includes a web interface for browsing the contents of the development database at:

   http://localhost:5555

3. Scalar API Documentation Renderer

   The Scalar library automatically generates web-based API documentation for the server based on the
   Swagger/OpenAPI schema definitions included with each route, viewable at:

   http://localhost:5000/api/reference

4. Minio

   The Docker Compose configuration includes the Minio object storage server as a local development
   simulation of AWS S3. You can browse the contents of the storage server at:

   http://localhost:9001

   Username and password are: minioadmin/minioadmin

## Testing

This repo includes a Github Actions workflow for running server tests. To test locally, log in
to a running server container as describe above (`docker compose exec server bash -l`) and then run
`npm test`. The server tests use the Testcontainers library to automatically launch test databases and
storage servers for testing- if tests terminate unexpectedly, you may have dangling/orphan containers
running. Use `docker ps` to list and check running containers.

## Shell Command Quick Reference

- Every directory and file on your computer has a _path_ that describes its location in storage. Special path symbols include:

  - The current _working directory_ you are in: `.`
  - The _parent_ of the current working directory: `..`
  - Your _home_ directory: `~`
  - The _root_ directory: `/` (Mac, Linux) or `\` (Windows)
    - The same symbol is used as a _separator_ when specifying multiple directories in a path
    - If the path _starts_ with the separator, it means the path starts at the _root_
      - For example: `/Users/myusername/Documents`
      - This is called an _absolute_ path
    - If the path _does not start_ with the separator, it means the path starts at the current _working directory_
      - For example, if the current _working directory_ is: `/Users`  
        then the same path as the previous example is: `myusername/Documents`
      - This is called a _relative_ path
    - A path can also start with any of the above special path symbols
      - For example, on Mac the same path as the previous example is: `~/Documents`

- To _print the working directory_ (i.e. to see the full path of the directory you are currently in):

  ```
  pwd
  ```

- To _list_ the files in the working directory:

  ```
  ls -l
  ```

- To _change_ the working directory:

  ```
  cd path
  ```

- To _make_ a new directory inside the working directory:

  ```
  mkdir newpath
  ```

- To create a new _empty file_ inside the working directory:

  ```
  touch filename.ext
  ```

## git Command Quick Reference

- To check the _status_ of the files in your local repo (i.e. what's been added or changed):

  ```
  git status
  ```

- To _add all_ the changed files to the next commit:

  ```
  git add .
  ```

  To _add specific file(s)_ to the next commit:

  ```
  git add path/to/file1.ext path/to/file2.ext path/with/wildcard/*
  ```

- To _commit_ the added files with a message:

  ```
  git commit -m "My description of what's changed"
  ```

- To _push_ the commit to the remote repo:

  ```
  git push
  ```

- To _pull_ any new commits from the remote repo:

  ```
  git pull
  ```

## Docker Command Quick Reference

- To start all the containers:

  ```
  docker compose up
  ```

- To log in to the running server container:

  ```
  docker compose exec server bash -l
  ```

- To stop all the containers, in case things didn't shutdown properly with CTRL-C:

  ```
  docker compose stop
  ```

- To run the server container without starting everything using the up command:

  ```
  docker compose run --rm server bash -l
  ```

- To re-build the server container:

  ```
  docker compose build server
  ```

## Windows Docker Notes

- On some PC laptops, a hardware CPU feature called virtualization is disabled by default, which is required. To enable it, reboot your computer into its BIOS interface (typically by pressing a key like DELETE, ESC, or F1 during the boot process), and look for an option to enable it. It may be called something like _Intel Virtualization Technology_, _Intel VT_, _AMD-V_, or some similar variation.

  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-11-pcs-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1

- Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and make sure to check "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V" when installing Docker Desktop for Windows.

  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install  
  https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

- Use Microsoft Terminal to open a command-line shell running in your WSL distribution (typically Ubuntu), and use the git command line to _clone this project into your Linux filesystem_. If you attempt to run this project in Docker from the Windows file system, performance will be degraded and file change detection will not work. Editors like VSCode can edit files in the Linux filesystem of WSL.
